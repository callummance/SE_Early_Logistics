	"description": "Space exploration locks away a few reletively low tech researches until after you've created multiple interplanetary bases. This mod rebalances the some of the important early-mid game research so that it's easier to get which makes early game SE less of a drag for a second playthrough. Based on Xeraster's `Space Exploration Easier Early/Midgame Important Research` mod, but with more options and fixed for Krastorio2.",
